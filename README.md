# timeurls: measure response time for URL requests

This async demo started out as a response to
[a Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/zvj34q/comment/j1q3b90/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3);
the code was initially borrowed from there, but has been
extensively cleaned up.

The program grabs "index.html" from a variety of commercial
URLs (impolite, but they can handle it) and measures
response time.
